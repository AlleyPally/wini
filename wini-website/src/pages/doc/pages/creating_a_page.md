# Creating a page

You can easily create a page, a component or a layout by using

```
wini new page # or component or layout
```

## Capabilities of wini CLI

All the commands in wini (excepted `init`) are a mapping of [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just).

`just` is a command runner tool and a modern alternative to [`make`](https://www.gnu.org/software/make/). You can see the list of all the commands premade by either looking at `./justfile` or by doing

```
just -l # which is more or less the same as `wini help`
```

<!-- Maybe rename that to understanding wini CLI -->
